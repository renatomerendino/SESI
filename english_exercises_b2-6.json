      "passage": "Podcasting has exploded in popularity over the last decade, transforming from a niche hobby into a mainstream medium. A podcast is essentially a digital audio file, usually episodic, that users can download to a personal device for easy listening. The format's appeal lies in its accessibility and versatility. Listeners can tune in during commutes, while exercising, or during household chores, making it a perfect medium for multitasking. The range of content is vast, covering everything from investigative journalism and in-depth interviews to comedy and fictional storytelling. This diversity means there's a podcast for almost every interest imaginable. For creators, the relatively low barrier to entry—often just a microphone and basic editing software—has empowered countless individuals and organizations to share their voices and stories with a global audience. However, the sheer volume of content has created a new challenge: discoverability. With millions of podcasts available, standing out and finding an audience can be difficult for new creators. Despite this, the medium continues to grow, influencing everything from marketing strategies to how we consume news and entertainment.",
