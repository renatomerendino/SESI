      "passage": "Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the 'Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle' waste hierarchy. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing energy usage, air pollution, and water pollution. Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing. However, recycling is not always straightforward. The process can be costly, and some materials are difficult to recycle. Furthermore, contamination of recyclable materials with non-recyclable items can make the entire batch unusable. Despite these challenges, promoting effective recycling programs and educating the public on proper sorting are crucial steps toward a more sustainable future.",
