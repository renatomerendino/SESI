      "passage": "The 'gig economy' refers to a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs. Digital platforms like Uber, Deliveroo, and Upwork are central to this model, connecting service providers directly with customers. This system offers undeniable flexibility, which is a major draw for many workers who can choose their own hours and be their own boss. It allows individuals to supplement their income or work around other commitments, such as education or family care. However, the gig economy has also faced significant criticism. A primary concern is the lack of job security and benefits. Gig workers are typically classified as independent contractors, meaning they often do not receive health insurance, paid sick leave, or retirement contributions from the companies they work for. This can lead to financial instability, especially when work is inconsistent. There is an ongoing debate about the legal classification of these workers, with some arguing they should be treated as employees to ensure fair labor rights. As the gig economy continues to expand, it is reshaping our understanding of work and employment in the 21st century.",
