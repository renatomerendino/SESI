      "passage": "Urban farming is the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in or around urban areas. It can involve anything from rooftop gardens and vertical farms to community plots in public parks. This movement is gaining traction worldwide as a response to challenges like food insecurity, long supply chains, and a disconnect between people and their food sources. One of the primary benefits of urban farming is increased access to fresh, healthy produce in 'food deserts'â€”areas where affordable, nutritious food is scarce. It also reduces 'food miles,' the distance food travels from farm to consumer, which in turn lowers carbon emissions. Furthermore, urban farms can transform unused or derelict spaces into green, productive community hubs, fostering social cohesion and providing educational opportunities. However, the practice is not without its obstacles. Urban growers often face challenges such as soil contamination from past industrial use, limited space, and local regulations that may not be designed to accommodate agriculture. Securing funding and land tenure can also be significant hurdles. Despite these difficulties, proponents believe that with innovative techniques and supportive policies, urban farming can play a crucial role in creating more resilient and sustainable cities for the future.",
