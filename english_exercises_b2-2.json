      "passage": "Dr. Sarah Martinez has been working as a marine biologist for fifteen years, but her recent discovery in the Pacific Ocean has changed everything she thought she knew about deep-sea creatures. Last summer, while exploring a previously unmapped underwater canyon, she and her team discovered a new species of bioluminescent fish that seems to communicate through patterns of light. The fish, which they named 'Lumina profundus', lives at depths of over 2,000 meters where sunlight never reaches. What makes this discovery particularly exciting is that these fish appear to have developed a complex social structure based entirely on light signals. Dr. Martinez spent months analyzing the footage and finally published her findings in the Journal of Marine Science. The discovery has attracted international attention, and several research institutions have already contacted her team to collaborate on further studies. This breakthrough could revolutionize our understanding of how life adapts to extreme environments.",
