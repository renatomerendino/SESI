      "passage": "The concept of 'fast fashion'—inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends—has dramatically changed the fashion industry and our shopping habits. While it makes trendy clothing accessible to more people, it comes at a significant environmental and social cost. The production process often involves high water consumption, toxic dyes, and synthetic fabrics that do not biodegrade. This leads to vast amounts of textile waste, as garments are often worn only a few times before being discarded. Furthermore, to keep prices low, production is often outsourced to countries with lax labor regulations, leading to poor working conditions and low wages for garment workers. Consumers are becoming more aware of these issues and are starting to seek out more sustainable alternatives, such as buying second-hand, choosing clothes made from eco-friendly materials, and supporting brands that are transparent about their supply chains. The shift towards 'slow fashion' encourages buying fewer items of higher quality that will last longer.",
