      "passage": "The ancient city of Pompeii continues to reveal its secrets nearly 2,000 years after Mount Vesuvius buried it in volcanic ash. Recently, archaeologists working in the Regio V area made an extraordinary discovery: a perfectly preserved fast-food restaurant, known as a 'thermopolium' in ancient Roman times. The counter still contains traces of food that was being served when the eruption occurred in 79 AD. Analysis of the residues has revealed duck, goat, pig, fish, and even snails on the menu. The frescoes decorating the walls depict the very ingredients that were sold there, including chickens and mallard ducks hanging upside down, ready to be cooked. This discovery provides invaluable insight into the daily eating habits of ordinary Romans. The thermopolium was clearly a popular meeting place, as evidenced by the graffiti found on the walls, including insults and drawings left by customers. Professor Maria Rossi, who leads the excavation team, believes this find will revolutionize our understanding of Roman food culture and social customs.",
