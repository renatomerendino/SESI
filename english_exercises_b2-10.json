      "passage": "Regular physical exercise is fundamental for maintaining both physical and mental health. Physically, it strengthens the heart, improves blood circulation, and helps manage weight, which significantly reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Mentally, exercise has been proven to be a powerful mood booster. It stimulates the production of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators. Engaging in physical activity can also reduce feelings of anxiety and depression, improve sleep quality, and boost self-esteem. Whether it's a brisk walk, a bike ride, or a dance class, finding an enjoyable activity is key to staying consistent. The benefits are not just long-term; even a single session of moderate exercise can lead to immediate improvements in energy levels and mental clarity.",
